## Personal Project 1 - Graphing Calculator 
--------------------------
## The Problem Statement:
## Goals 
- To create a calculator capable of graphing iterative equations like the mandelbrot set. 
## Boundaries / Scope 
- This calculator does not need to be able to perform basic arithmetic functions for the user. Its sole purpose will be to graph fractals. 
## Success criteria
- The calculator works
- It produces the expected result every time.
- Results can be compared to existing graphs of equations.
## Constraints 
- Having to spend time relearning c++ 
## Assumptions 
- c++ will most likely be the easiest language to program this in.
## Stakeholders 
- Professor: this is an assignment for this class.
- Myself: if this project is done right, I will have proven to myself that I am capable of becoming a good programmer.
## Timelines
- Week 1: establishing the limits of what the calculator can do. How far do I want to go? (2 hrs)
- Week 2-4: using learncpp.com, cplusplus.com, and the LVP c++ textbook to refresh my knowledge of c++. (1-2 hrs per day as needed)
- Week 5-12: programming the calculator. (3 hrs per week)

## Inspection 2
- I have completed reading the online tutorial on cplusplus.com, so my understanding of the language is far greater than before. I have started to program the functionality of the calculator. Variables have been set up to take input from the user and use them in the equation z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c. The next step is to incorporate a GUI capable of actually graphing the function and making a different color for each iteration. The best possible solution to this is to use the window class. Tutorials online are not so clear as to how to do exactly what I want.
