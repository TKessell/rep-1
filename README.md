## Personal Project 1
This readme serves as a log for my progress in my first personal project for Professor VanSelow. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Goals 
- To create a calculator capable of graphing iterative equations like the mandelbrot set. 
## Boundaries / Scope 
- This calculator does not need to be able to perform basic arithmetic functions for the user. Its sole purpose will be to graph fractals. 
## Success criteria
- The calculator works
- It produces the expected result every time.
- Results can be compared to existing graphs of equations.
## Constraints 
- Having to spend time relearning c++ 
## Assumptions 
- c++ will most likely be the easiest language to program this in.
## Stakeholders 
- Professor: this is an assignment for this class.
- Myself: if this project is done right, I will have proven to myself that I am capable of becoming a good programmer.
## Timelines
- Week 1: establishing the limits of what the calculator can do. How far do I want to go?
- Week 2-4: using learncpp.com to refresh my knowledge on math in c++.
- Week 5-?: programming the calculator.
