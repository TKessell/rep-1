## Personal Project 1 - Graphing Calculator 
--------------------------
## The Problem Statement:
## Goals 
- To create a calculator capable of graphing iterative equations like the mandelbrot set. 
## Boundaries / Scope 
- This calculator does not need to be able to perform basic arithmetic functions for the user. Its sole purpose will be to graph fractals. 
## Success criteria
- The calculator works
- It produces the expected result every time.
- Results can be compared to existing graphs of equations.
## Constraints 
- Having to spend time relearning c++ 
## Assumptions 
- c++ will most likely be the easiest language to program this in.
## Stakeholders 
- Professor: this is an assignment for this class.
- Myself: if this project is done right, I will have proven to myself that I am capable of becoming a good programmer.
## Timelines
- Week 1: establishing the limits of what the calculator can do. How far do I want to go? (2 hrs)
- Week 2-4: using learncpp.com, cplusplus.com, and the LVP c++ textbook to refresh my knowledge of c++. (1-2 hrs per day as needed)
- Week 5-12: programming the calculator. (3 hrs per week)

## Inspection 2
- I have completed reading the online tutorial on cplusplus.com, so my understanding of the language is far greater than before. I have started to program the functionality of the calculator. Variables have been set up to take input from the user and use them in the equation z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c. If you are using notepad++, make sure you have the plugins manager plugin installed (which is found here http://npppluginmgr.sourceforge.net/). From there, select and install nppexec. Then, when viewing the mandelbrot source code in notepad++, press F6 and paste the exact script from "npp_complile_sript.txt" file.
